# CSAMOMC
Source code for paper:
"A multiâ€‘objective crow search algorithm for optimizing makespan and costs in scientific cloud workflows (CSAMOMC)"  
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00607-024-01263-4

Everyone can use it in their research and remember to add reference to the paper. 
It is not the lastest version, but near the lastest one. 
For generating scientific workflows such as Ligo, Montage and others, I used Java code from source (bharathi folder): 


https://github.com/pegasus-isi/WorkflowGenerator

Folder in my project is: 
heft\graph\src\simulation\generator

When workflows are generated, they were saved to do experiments on the same workflows. 
Generated workflows also are in the source code in Xml format, in "heft\graph" folder. 

For meta-heuristics I inspired pymoo and pygmo libraries.
